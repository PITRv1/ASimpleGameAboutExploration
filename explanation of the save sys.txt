We have some default file with the components saved into it and. If we want we can load it to reset the save file we have. Otherwise the save sys is gonna load the last save n starup and load the values from it into the effected components. When saving we first check for the last save file and if we have one we just simpoly update the values inside of it instead of writing a whole new save file. This way we need only update the changed values and we can safely skip the none effected values. I already spoiled how the component saver works. The saveable components have a hasChanged flag which is set if a change is detected and as of 05/21 are set to true by default so that they get saved no matter what on first scene change. 05/21 As of this time I still save some variables into deffault variable instead of the save data so I need to change that. So we propagate that save file forward and just chagne it instead of overwriting.
